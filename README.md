# side_project_weibo_hot

## Side Project Background
> Inspired by Bilingual Podcast who is the best podcast channel in Taiwan that introduce the interesting news happening around the world. They said they had a problem that they can not get the hot news from weibo immediately before Xi made it disappear. For instance, Shuai Peng(彭帥) and Zhang Gaoli(張高麗) event. So, I wrote a sideproject about automatic web system that can refresh the web page and download it automatically and keep the data safe.

## Some Set Up
> 1. Make sure your web driver is the latest version. You can download it here(https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)

> 2. Make sure your desktop is the idle one in your home that you'll not use it for a while.

> 3.

## Something can solve in the future
> 1. The content data you download may not be the same as the latest because I just verify the hot news title before downloading.

> 2. Maybe someone can wrote about login part that not only need account and password but the id verification. This is very hard to solve in this system.

> 3. To be continued
